# Mongoscraper

## Description

Mongo Scraper is a news scraper website. It is designed to scrape articles from different news sites and pull them into a MongoDB database. We use Mongoose to create structure for the database. The articles are then displayed in an easy fashion with an article title, snippet and link to the article. A user can save an article to create notes on if they choose to. 

The app is only set up to Scrape articles from the New York Times. However, you can easily create new "scrape" routes to fit the model and add to the database.

## Technologies

I am using MongoDB as the backend database. We are using Express and mongoose for backend routing and database shaping. On the frontend there is a lot of javascript functionality with GET/POST/DELETE/PUT Ajax requests. The design is mostly Bootstrap components with some basic CSS to make it look a little nicer.
